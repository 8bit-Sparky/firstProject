	<h1>Paragraph Practice</h1>

	<p> This is me doing this another time again. I first did this was at public school in my Tech Today class. 
It has been a while since I did this, so I'm a litte rough. Don't worry, I'll get back into it.

	<p> 
Spacing does not matter, it will look like the others.
	</p>
<p> 	Does tab work. 	How about spacing
 		Will they stay there??? I'll have to save to find out

	<h2>End of paragraph practice.</h2>
